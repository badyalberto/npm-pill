**NPM** is a tool that manages the **dependencies** of our Javascript project, both in client and in backend (NodeJs). Thanks to this tool, we can work with the installation of those modules that our project needs in a comfortable way, avoiding all the problems involved in installing the dependencies manually and without any control or supervision.

## Objetives

> Understand that it is a dependency manager.
> Understand what NPM is and what its fundamentals are.
> Improve your knowledge in Javascript in professional work environments
> Improve your knowledge regarding Javascript Modules.
> Understand how to use third party libraries and packages in your project without the need to store them in your repository, that is the one of the wonders of this amazing programming tools.

## Steps

1. Analize project dependencies (MomentJS,Lodash,Jest,JQuery)
2. Create a new project and configure it to not include third-party dependencies (add node_module/ to .gitignore)
3. Verify or install node (node -v)
4. NPM (npm -v)
5. Install Moment JS dependency in the last version (npm install moment)
6. Install lodash dependency in the specific version (npm i lodash@4.17.14)
7. Install JQuery as production dependency (npm i --save-prod jquery)
8. Install Jest as development dependency (npm i --save-dev jest)
9. Uninstall jQuery dependency (npm uninstall jquery)
10. Update NPM (npm update -g npm)
